## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply click the icons you need from [dumblebird.in](https://dumblebird.in), and you can download them in either SVG or PNG format.

Designers can easily copy the SVG code by clicking the `Copy SVG` button, then paste it directly into design tools using `âŒ˜+V` or `Ctrl+V`.

> We recommend that designers download or copy icons only as needed from our website, rather than managing them in a local folder. The website's search engine allows you to find icons quickly, and icons are continuously updated.
>
> The `Copy SVG` feature supports tools like Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD, Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer, and Affinity Photo.

For web usage, embedding an SVG is as simple as using JPEG or PNG:

```html
<img height="32" width="32" src="img/admin-fill.svg" />
